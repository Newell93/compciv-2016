Project: Show Me Where

#About the dataset.

This is **Shane** and his pitch for a neat data project. My *dataset* comes from the San Francisco Police Department. The *dataset* dates back to Jan. 1, 2003. The data is updated continuously, and it seems to be two weeks behind today's date. There are at least 12 columns with references to latitudinal and longitudinal data. I want to focus on where San Francisco's **drug/narcotic** arrests take place. This is a link to the massive, unfiltered dataset:

#Basic facts about the dataset
* The location data is very clean. It has exact coordinates that can be fed into the program, so that users can easily spot where drug crimes 
* The categories can be easily sorted. This is key so that I can break down the **drug/narcotic** sub-category.
* It's a *csv* file. **AWESOME!**

#Description
- **IncidentNum** This is a police code identifying the incident.

- **Category** Because the crime list is so large, it's broken down into roughly a dozen. I'll focus on incidents in the drug/narcotic category.

- **Description** This is a subset of category. It is a more focused description of what transpired. A description of the drug category could be a methamphetamine bust.

- **Day of Week, Date, Time** Self-explanatory. Written in military time, MM/DD/YYYY.

- **PdDistrict** Where did this happen?

- **Resolution** Was the person released? Was an arrest made?

- **Address** This is an imprecise location of where it occurred. It's usually listed as the 300 block of ABC Street.

- **X** Latitude

- **Y** Longitude
