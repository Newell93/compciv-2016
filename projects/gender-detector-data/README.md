# Automated Gender Analysis of Guest Stars on The Simpsons

# Introduction:

This is a gender analysis of guest stars who appeared on "The Simpsons" for the show's first 26 seasons. The data came from a list generated from Wikipedia. 

After a bit of cleaning, I narrowed the data into four columns: **Season, First_Name, Last_Name, Episode**. For the sake of my sanity, I elminated the episode numbers and production codes from the original dataset. I named my new dataset, which had been cleaned in Microsoft Excel, to guests-simpsons.csv.
