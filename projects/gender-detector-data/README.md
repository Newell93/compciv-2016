# Automated Gender Analysis of Guest Stars on The Simpsons

# Introduction:

This is a gender analysis of guest stars who appeared on "The Simpsons" for the show's first 26 seasons. The data came from a list generated from Wikipedia. 

After a bit of cleaning, I narrowed the data into four columns: **Season, First, Last, Episode**. 'First' refers to first_name, and 'Last' directs to last_name. 

For the sake of my sanity, I elminated the episode numbers and production codes from the original dataset contained in Wikipedia. I named my new dataset, which had been cleaned in Microsoft Excel, to guests-simpsons.csv. 

The idea for this gender analysis came from the **#Oscarssowhite** controversy. For decades, Hollywood has been an industry dominated by white men and women. I wanted to see if the racial and gender disparity applied to The Simpsons, long considered the definitive American TV show of the past 25 years. 

Because I couldn't determine one's race by their name, I wanted to see if The Simpsons had a gender disparity when it came to its guest stars. My hypothesis was that 90% of the guest stars were men. Here's what I found.
