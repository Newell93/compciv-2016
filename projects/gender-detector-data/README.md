# Automated Gender Analysis of Guest Stars on The Simpsons

# Introduction:

This is a gender analysis of guest stars who appeared on "The Simpsons" for the show's first 26 seasons. The data came from a list generated from Wikipedia. 

After a bit of cleaning, I narrowed the data into four columns: **Season, First, Last, Episode**. 'First' refers to first_name, and 'Last' directs to last_name. 

For the sake of my sanity, I elminated the episode numbers and production codes from the original dataset contained in Wikipedia. I named my new dataset, which had been cleaned in Microsoft Excel, to guests-simpsons.csv. 

The idea for this gender analysis came from the **#Oscarssowhite** controversy.
